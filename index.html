					This was the first iteration of our pinhole camera, which posed a few issues for us -- namely, the index cards that we used for our pinholes were not thick enough to effectively block out the surrounding light, so we were unable to obtain an image. Our box was also letting in too much light, and the tape that was exposed inside of the camera was far too reflective, so it created strange artifacts in our image.

					These images show our final pinhole camera design, which features a box that is completely sealed with aluminum foil and duct tape. We covered the inside of the box with another layer of black/white paper, this time utilizing double sided tape to adhere the covering without allowing the tape to interfere with the image inside the camera. We also repositioned the digital camera so that it was able to capture a better portion of the white screen where the image would be projected.Lastly, we altered the materials we were using as the diaphragm for the pinhole so that it would actually block out the light rays that did not directly pass through the desired pinhole. As pictured above, we used a thin sheet of cardboard that was also covered in aluminum foil, and created each of the three holes in this sheet. We found that this design was quite effective.The results that we were able to capture are pictured below.

					All of these images were captured with a 2mm pinhole. While the 1mm pinhole produced clearer images, it was often simply not bright enough to generate a good image. Thus, we decided to take our additional pictures with the brighter, but still repectable clear, 2mm pinhole.
