					<p> To start designing our camera, we followed the instructions that were set out in the given <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~wjarosz/courses/cs89-fa15/pa1.html">assignment description</a>. 
					For our digital camera, we used a Canon PowerShot A560. We were limited by the fact that this camera is roughly 10 years old, and is fairly basic. The most impactful restriction was the fact that the length of the shutter speed maxed out at 15 seconds, so we were unable to counter-act dim lighting conditions by increasing the exposure time any further. However, we were able to compensate for this by setting the exposure to +2, and by increasing the ISO from 80 to 200.</p>

					<p>We used a printer paper box for the basis of our pinhole camera, which was approximately 455mm D x 300mm W x 250mm H. Using the formula given in section 3 of the project assignment, we arrived at the following measurement for our ideal pinhole size:</p>
						<p>1.9(f*lambda)^(1/2) = 1.9(455mm*550nm)^(1/2) = 0.94mm</p>
					<p>With this measurement in hand, we began our experiments with pinholes of the following sizes: 0.1mm, 1mm, and 2mm. However, after a few rounds of experimentation, we found that the 0.1mm pinhole (and other similar options less than 1mm) simply didn't allow enough light into the box to make it a feasible choice, particularly given the limitations of the digital camera we were using to capture the images inside the box. Thus, we decided to continue our experiementation with pinholes of size 1mm, 2mm, and 4mm. All of our results will reflect this decision. </p>

						This was the first iteration of our pinhole camera, in which we covered the interior of the box and it's lid with with black paper, and included a white paper screen on the back wall, where the image would be projected. We cut two holes in the front face of the box, which allowed for our various apertures (in the rectangular opening) and the lens of our digital camera (in the circular opening). We quickly found that this design posed a few issues for us -- namely, the index cards that we used for our pinholes were not thick enough to effectively block out the surrounding light, so we were unable to obtain an image. Our box was also letting in too much light, and the tape that was exposed inside of the camera was far too reflective, so it created strange artifacts in our image.

						These images show our final pinhole camera design, which features a box that is completely sealed with aluminum foil and duct tape. We covered the inside of the box with another layer of black/white paper, this time utilizing double sided tape to adhere the covering without allowing the tape to interfere with the image inside the camera. We also repositioned the digital camera so that it was able to capture a better portion of the white screen where the image would be projected.Lastly, we altered the materials we were using as the diaphragm for the pinhole so that it would actually block out the light rays that did not directly pass through the desired pinhole. As pictured above, we used a thin sheet of cardboard that was also covered in aluminum foil, and created each of the three holes in this sheet. We found that this design was quite effective. The results that we were able to capture are pictured below.

					This series of images was taken by placing our camera on the wall outside of Kemeny Hall, and pointing it down toward Moore Hall. We chose this location because there was a decent amount of sunlight, and also some great contrast between different elements of the scene. For this particular series, we tried to implement one of Professor Jarosz's suggestions, which involved placing a cone (or in our case, a cylinder) around the pinhole to very clearly define our field of view. This helped us to determine where exactly our image was being projected inside the camera, which allowed us to optimize the positioning of the digital camera in later photoshoots. As is to be expected, the images become considerably blurrier as you move from 1mm aperture (which is remarkably clear) to the larger 4mm aperture (which is quite fuzzy). Similarly, the overall brightness of the image increases dramatically as you move from the smaller aperture to the larger ones.

					This series of images was taken from a lamppost near Tuck Drive, looking up at Baker Tower. The images show a drastic change in the overall brightness of the image, solely as a result of the relative size of the pinhole that we used -- at 4mm, the image was nearly blown out in places, resulting in a loss of detail; contrarily, the image is difficult to see at 1mm, because there is not enough light to properly expose it. As we expected, the image is very blurry with the 4mm pinhole, but as we approached 1mm, the image becomes significantly clearer.

					All of the above images were captured with a 2mm pinhole. While the 1mm pinhole usually produced clearer images, it was precariously dependendent on there being enough light coming in from outside to properly expose the picture (refer to comparison below). Since it was unfortunately quite cloudy on the day when we were able to obtain our last 3 images (the rightmost images in this figure), the 1mm pinhole simply wasn't able to gather enough light to produce an image that could be recorded with our digital camera. Thus, we decided to take our additional pictures with the brighter, but still repectably clear, 2mm pinhole.

						These images are meant to compare the relative brightness of the 1mm pinhole and the 2mm pinhole, even on an extremely sunny day. This drastic reduction in brightness ultimately led us to forfeit some image clarity (given by the 1mm) in favor of a brighter image (given by the 2mm).

						These images show the process of setting up the camera obscura in Allison's room. We initially covered all three of her windows with heavy duty black garbage bags, but even with the blinds and the bags, a decent amount of light was seeping into the room from places other than the pinhole. Thus, Allison set out to cover all the problem areas with an additional layer of aluminum foil, as seen above. The rightmost picture shows the garbage bags draped across the mantle, which were placed there in an effort to create a more uniform surface for the image to project onto.

					This series of images displays the results that we got from the camera obscura that we created in Allison's room. The image on the left shows the room roughly as it appeared to us, as it was taken with a 1 second shutter speed. The rightmost images feature the longer exposure times of 15s, and the enlarged hole of 10cm.
				</p>
				<p>
					We measured the distance from the pinhole to the projection surface to be approximately 3302mm, which gave us an ideal pinhole size of roughly 2.5mm. However, with this size pinhole we were unable to gather enough light to produce a decently exposed picture, particularly with the cloudy weather that occurred while we were doing our extra credit. Thus, we decided to increase the size of the pinhole until we had enough light to properly expose the image. Ultimately, we ended up with a pinhole that was roughly 10cm in diameter, which is why the final image is a little blurry.
